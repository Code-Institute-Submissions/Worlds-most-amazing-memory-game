## Design Choices 
The theme for this game is going to be comic book Marvel characters. 
The colour scheme will need to be bright and appealing and try to 
co inside with the imagery of the marvel universe characters used on each of the 
memory game tiles. 

### Fonts:
I chose to use the font Anton as it was the closest i could find to a comic book style font as the actual marvel font is 
copywritten. but i think it fits in well with the style.

### Colours:
Using knowledge from prior research of the marvel comic books the colours will
need to be bright and eye cacthing with a darker background and I will try to match the colour scheme to
the imagery of the marvel comic book characters used.

* background-color: #061435 dark blue 
* Tile colour: #ed1d24 red
* lettering colour: #fff white

here is a link to the colour pallette ill be using.

### Styling:
I choose a comic book style font and used the colours from the marvel logo in the 
theme for the rest of the site.

##Testing:

The site is responsive over different screen sizes with custom layouts where appropriate. The site has been tested on Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome and safari and works as intended.The site was tested on an android phone, Iphone, Ipad, laptop, and desktop. All site functions work as intended.

The console displays no errors during site testing

During planning for this project i knew that i needed to have good testing in place for during and after the projects build/completion, thanks to the layout being organised in the wireframes i was able to select what feature to work on, organise how i was going to approach  
each section and follow my templates to check that it had been implemented correctly and works as expected. In future projects i would look to include more automated testing to help me with my tests.
