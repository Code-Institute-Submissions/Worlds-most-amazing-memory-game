## Design Choices 
The theme for this game is going to be comic book Marvel characters. 
The colour scheme will need to be bright and appealing and try to 
co inside with the imagery of the marvel universe characters used on each of the 
memory game tiles. 

### Fonts:
I chose to use the font Anton as it was the clsoest i could find to a comicbook style font as the actual marvel font is 
copywritten. but i think it fits in well with the style.

### Colours:
Using knowledge from prior research of the marvel comic books the colours will
need to be bright and eye cacthing with a darker background and I will try to match the colour scheme to
the imagery of the marvel comic book characters used.

* background-color: #061435 dark blue 
* Tile colour: #ed1d24 red
* lettering colour: #fff white


### Styling:
I choose a comic book style font and used the colours from the marvel logo in the 
theme for the rest of the site.
