## Design Choices 
The theme for this game is going to be comic book Marvel characters. 
The colour scheme will need to be bright and appealing and try to 
co inside with the imagery of the marvel universe characters used on each of the 
memory game tiles. 

### Fonts:
I chose to use the font Anton as it was the closest i could find to a comic book style font as the actual marvel font is 
copywritten. but i think it fits in well with the style.

### Colours:
Using knowledge from prior research of the marvel comic books the colours will
need to be bright and eye cacthing with a darker background and I will try to match the colour scheme to
the imagery of the marvel comic book characters used.

* background-color: #061435 dark blue 
* Tile colour: #ed1d24 red
* lettering colour: #fff white

here is a link to the colour pallette ill be using.

### Styling:
I choose a comic book style font and used the colours from the marvel logo in the 
theme for the rest of the site.

## Features developed:
* click counter
* Flip Cards with matching pictures

## Features To be Developed
* I would have liked to add a timer but didnt have time.
* I would have liked to add difficulty settings but also didnt have the time.

These features were on my wireframes but where then left out as development went on.

## Technologies Used:


### Languages;
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript


### Tools and Libraries:
* GIT
* Bootstrap
* google fonts

## Testing:

The site is responsive over different screen sizes with custom layouts where appropriate. The site has been tested on Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome and safari and works as intended.The site was tested on an android phone, Iphone, Ipad, laptop, and desktop. All site functions work as intended.

The console displays no errors during site testing

During planning for this project i knew that i needed to have good testing in place for during and after the projects build/completion, thanks to the layout being organised in the wireframes i was able to select what feature to work on, organise how i was going to approach each section and follow my templates to check that it had been implemented correctly and works as expected. In future projects i would look to include more automated testing to help me with my tests.

### Testing stories


*I had a friend play the game, they enjoyed it and found it easy to understand. There was no issues duirng play.

## Overall:

### Responsiveness -

    Plan : I knew that this project needed to be FULLY responsive and mobile friendly therefore the obvious option to use Bootstrap as this HTML Framework I'm most comfortable using. Testing using dev-tools throughout and also a final test of the entire site after completion.
    Implementation : Throughout writing my HTML code making sure to use appropriate bootstrap class modifiers to provide correct breakpoints for the content. Testing breakpoints was relatively simple thanks to the easy to use Bootstrap, i only really modified a few breakpoints after writing the majority of my HTML.
    Result : The Responsiveness of the site works as expected, no elements or content escape their boundaries or are hard to see on any device.
    Verdict : This test has passed and therefore the site is responsive.

### Design -

    Plan :The overall design of the site had to be bold and use exciting colours and imagery. Using vibrant colours like red, blue and white provide great contrast. 
    Implementation : Adding these colours through css allowed me to easily re use them for the different elements on the page.
    Result : The colours chosen work well for the theme of the site.
    Verdict : This test has passed and the overall colour scheme fits well for the purpose of the site.


## Features:

### Click counter -

    Plan : Durung planning i decided to add a click counter which was used as a countdown to wether or not a user won or lost the game. if all the cards where matched before the click counter went down they won. if not they lost.
    Implementation : using javascript i was able to make a click counter that worked on every click the user made while playing the game.
    Result : The click works effortlessly and cleanly. This is also fully responsive.
    Verdict : This test passed as the click counter works on all devices.

### flip cards with matching pictures -

    Plan : the main aim of the game was to match cards that showed up when the user clicked on them and they would have to remember them to find the matching cards.
    Implementation : i used javascript to make the cards flip when the user clicked on them by adding a class with another image called flip. i learned this from youtube.
    Result : the cards flip over then the user clicks and they stay flipped over when two cards are matched.
    Verdict : the cards stay matched and flip back if they dont on all devices with no issues.
