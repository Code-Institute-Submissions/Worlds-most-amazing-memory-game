## Design Choices 
The theme for this game is going to be comic book Marvel characters. 
The colour scheme will need to be bright and appealing and try to 
co inside with the imagery of the marvel universe characters used on each of the 
memory game tiles. 

### Fonts:

### Colours:
Using knowledge from prior research of the marvel comic books the colours will
need to be bright and eye cacthing with a darker background and I will try to match the colour scheme to
the imagery of the marvel comic book characters used.

* background-color: #061435 dark blue 
* Tile colour: #ed1d24 red
* lettering colour: #fff white


### Styling:


## Wireframes:

I've used cacoo.com to do a mockup of the website design in black and white.
First I started by doing a very basic wireframe design for desktop tablet and mobile
just to get a better understanding of how all the elements were going to look 
on the page.  Ther is a m,ockup in the subfolder 'wireframes' and below is a link to the
website i used to make them.
